## 1.1 COMPUTER MOUSE

### Identify the types of testing you would perform on a computer mouse, to make sure that it is of the highest quality.

Check if the sensor is good by moving the mouse across the mouse-pad. 
Pressing the buttons a bunch of times to see if it registers the presses.
Gripping the mouse hard and see if the build is robust and good. 
And last see how smooth the scroll wheel is.

## 1.2 CATASTROPHIC FAILURE

## Find a story where a software system defect had a bad outcome. Describe what happened. Can you identify a test that would have prevented it?

Idk if this is relavant.
When I was in internship. I had to code in Excel VBA and had to fetch large amounts of data. 
long story short, VBA 2016 did not like all of that data and would crash Excel every 2 hours. 
(no garbage collection, and no way of adding it)
and i dont think test could have fix the problem.
