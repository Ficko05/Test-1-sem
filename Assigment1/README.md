• What was positive and good about using TDD?

You notice errors faster, so you dont have to manually find the problems later.

You find errors before the users find them.

You can confidently refactor the code afterwards.

You think about the design of the code before you start to code.

• What was annoying or difficult?#

Getting used to write a test first, and purposely getting a "first" error. and
writing "double" as much code

• What surprised you?#

How easy it can be.

• Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldn’t otherwise have thought of?

I would never had written a test befor.
